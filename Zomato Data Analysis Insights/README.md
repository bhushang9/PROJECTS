🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis and Insights!
=======================================================
📜 Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing Zomato's restaurant data to generate actionable insights. The goal is to understand customer preferences, restaurant performance, and ordering trends, while also identifying anomalies and testing hypotheses. The findings can be used by Zomato to optimize their operations, enhance customer experience, and implement strategic decisions.

-------------------------------------------------------
🔍 Problem Statements
-------------------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ What are the most popular types of restaurants based on customer orders?

2️⃣ How many votes does each restaurant category receive, and how does it reflect customer preferences?

3️⃣ What is the distribution of restaurant ratings, and what does it reveal about customer satisfaction?

4️⃣ What are the spending habits of couples, and what is their average expenditure per order?

5️⃣ How do the ratings differ between online and offline ordering modes?

6️⃣ Which restaurant type receives the highest offline orders, and how can Zomato target these customers with offers?

7️⃣ Are there any anomalies in the dataset, and what insights can be drawn from them?

8️⃣ Can hypotheses regarding ordering patterns and restaurant performance be validated using statistical testing?

🌟 Key Features of the Project
--------------------------------------------------------------
🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

-  Conversion of rate column to numeric for easier analysis.
-  Handling missing values and irrelevant data.


🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-  Restaurant Type Analysis: Count plot to identify the most common types.
-  Vote Distribution: Aggregating and visualizing total votes by restaurant type.
-  Rating Analysis: Histogram of restaurant ratings.
-  Spending Habits: Distribution of the approximate cost for two people.


📊 Insights and Visualizations:
-  Heatmaps for visualizing online vs offline ordering preferences.
-  Scatter plots for relationships between votes and ratings.
-  Bar charts for average cost analysis across restaurant types.


🚨 Anomaly Detection:
-  Using the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in votes, ratings, and costs.


🧪 Hypothesis Testing:
-  Online vs Offline Ratings: T-test to compare average ratings.
-  Dining Votes Comparison: T-test to evaluate vote differences between casual dining and other types.
